# AGC Powers Pvt. Limited
This is my first project ever. I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Bootstrap 5. Here are the features:

Smooth Scrolling: When you click on the navigation icons, the page smoothly scrolls to the corresponding section.
Auto-Counting: As you scroll down and enter the About section, a counter automatically starts increasing.
WhatsApp Button: There's a button that allows you to easily contact me on WhatsApp.
Go to Top Button: A convenient button lets you quickly return to the top of the page.
Lightbox Plugin (for Projects): I'm using a lightbox plugin to showcase project details in an overlay when you click on a project.
